# Unwrap Contract

## Overview

Unwrap is a decentralized protocol for verifiable sustainability credentials, leveraging Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. By providing a transparent, immutable platform, Unwrap enables precise tracking, verification, and certification of environmental impact efforts.

## Key Features

- **Impact Verification**: Multi-stakeholder validation of sustainability claims
- **Credential Issuance**: Generate blockchain-based impact credentials
- **Carbon Tracking**: Calculate and record carbon equivalent metrics
- **Transparent Auditing**: Immutable record of environmental contributions

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Sustainability Ledger

The core `sustainability-ledger.clar` smart contract provides:

- Impact type registration
- Project management
- Impact claim submission
- Verification workflows
- Credential generation
- Carbon equivalent calculations

## Verification Process

1. **Claim Submission**: Project owners submit impact claims with evidence
2. **Multi-Validator Review**: Community validators and external data sources verify claims
3. **Credential Issuance**: Verified impacts result in blockchain-based credentials

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control
- Multi-stakeholder verification
- Immutable record-keeping
- Transparent validation mechanisms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain and sustainability metrics

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Stacks development tools
3. Deploy the smart contract
4. Interact via contract functions

### Project Registry (`project-registry`)

The central registry for all sustainable development projects on the platform. Manages:
- Project creation and lifecycle
- Project metadata and status tracking
- Project discovery by category and location
- Collaborator management

Key features:
- Multiple project categories (reforestation, clean water, renewable energy, etc.)
- Project status tracking (proposed, active, completed, cancelled)
- Collaborative project management with role-based permissions
- Searchable project directory

### Funding Pool (`funding-pool`)

Handles the transparent collection and distribution of project funds. Provides:
- Secure fund collection
- Milestone-based fund releases
- Community-approved disbursements
- Refund mechanisms for failed projects

Key features:
- Project funding registration
- Contribution tracking
- Milestone-based fund releases
- Refund mechanisms
- Transparent transaction records

### Community Governance (`community-governance`)

Facilitates democratic decision-making for project management. Enables:
- Project approval voting
- Milestone validation
- Fund disbursement authorization
- Community-driven decisions

Key features:
- Proposal creation and voting
- Multiple proposal types
- Voting power management
- Proposal execution tracking

### Impact Verification (`impact-verification`)

Creates a system for recording and verifying environmental impact. Provides:
- Impact claim submission
- Multi-stakeholder verification
- Impact metrics tracking
- Sustainability credentials

Key features:
- Impact type registration
- Claim verification process
- External data source integration
- Impact credentials issuance
- Carbon equivalent calculations

## Contract Interactions

The contracts work together to create a complete ecosystem:

1. Projects are registered in the `project-registry`
2. Funding is managed through the `funding-pool`
3. Decisions are made via `community-governance`
4. Impact is verified through `impact-verification`

## Getting Started

To interact with the EcoTide platform:

1. Create a project using `project-registry`
2. Set up funding parameters in `funding-pool`
3. Establish governance rules through `community-governance`
4. Track and verify impact using `impact-verification`

## Development

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. Each contract is extensively documented with inline comments explaining its functionality.

To work with these contracts:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Clarity tools
3. Deploy contracts to the Stacks blockchain
4. Interact using contract functions

## Security Considerations

- Multi-stakeholder verification required for impact claims
- Role-based access control for project management
- Community-driven governance decisions
- Secure fund management with milestone-based releases
- Transparent and immutable record-keeping
